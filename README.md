# London – Liverpool Network Development

#### Project Overview
This Cisco Packet Tracer file corresponds to the network design and implementation project titled "London – Liverpool Network Development (Design and Implementation, Maintenance)." The project was authored by Alexandru-Mihai Sava under the supervision of Lecturer Zhanfang Zhao from the School of Engineering, London South Bank University. The Packet Tracer file represents a practical implementation of the theoretical concepts discussed in the associated report.

#### File Content
This file contains the complete network simulation setup for a proposed network system connecting locations in London and Liverpool. The design focuses on:

- **Departmental Segregation:** Ensuring that the network segments for employee departments are effectively separated from the company servers.
- **Firewall Configuration:** Implementing robust firewall settings to manage and control traffic flow, particularly during peak times, to enhance security and operational efficiency.

#### Design Objectives
The network design in this Packet Tracer file was developed to meet the specific requirements of the Managing and Technical Director. Key objectives include:

- Secure communication channels between London and Liverpool to prevent unauthorized access.
- System scalability and maintainability, adhering to current industry standards for future upgrades.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **Open Cisco Packet Tracer:** Launch your Cisco Packet Tracer application.
2. **Load the Provided File:** Navigate to the directory where this file is saved and open it in Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. **Explore the Network:** Review the network configuration including routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices.
4. **Simulation and Testing:** Utilize the simulation features of Cisco Packet Tracer to test the network’s performance and security measures.
